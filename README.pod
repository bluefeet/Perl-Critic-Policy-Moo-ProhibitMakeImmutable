=head1 NAME

Perl::Critic::Policy::Moo::ProhibitMakeImmutable - Makes sure that Moo classes
do not contain calls to make_immutable.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When migrating from L<Moose> to L<Moo> it can be a common issue to accidentally
leave in:

    __PACKAGE__->meta->make_immutable;

This policy complains if this exists in a Moo class as it triggers Moose to be
loaded and metaclass created, which defeats some of the benefits you get using
Moo instead of Moose.
